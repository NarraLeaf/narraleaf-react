### Performance

Please enable image cache for a better performance.  
Narraleaf-React tries to cache the images before showing them, but it is recommended to enable cache on your server.

for NextJS, add this to your `next.config.js`:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
        async headers() {
            return [
                {
                    source: '/YOUR_IMAGE_ENDPOINT/(.*)', // ex: /static/images/(.*)
                    headers: [
                        {
                            key: 'Cache-Control',
                            value: 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable',
                        },
                    ],
                }
            ]
        }
    };

export default nextConfig;
```
